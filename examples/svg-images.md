# A trivial example for SVG image testing

A fenced code block with an example parameter will set the code for an example:

~~~json example="blue line"
{
  "path": "M10,10L20,20",
  "color": "blue"
}
~~~

A PNG image with the description matching the fenced code example will set the expected output:

![blue line](images/blueline.png)
