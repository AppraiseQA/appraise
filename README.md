# Appraise -- Visual approval testing

This is a (research) project aimed at prototyping a tool for visual approval testing. The goals of the project are to build a tool that helps developers with the following tasks:

- Review and approve changes to browser components quickly through visual inspection 
- Automate acceptance/regression tests for visual look and feel in a visual language, rather than xUnit style code
- Speed up visual exploratory testing by making it easier to rebuild visual components from example data/configuration
- Build living documentation for API consumers/component users that is easy to maintain
- Publish developer docs with visual examples to github easily (markdown) or as a static site (html)
- Run visual tests quickly/in parallel using AWS Lambda
